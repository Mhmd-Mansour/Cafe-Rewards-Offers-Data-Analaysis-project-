•	Question 3: How many informational offers were followed by transactions?
o	Finding: 2 informational offers were followed by transactions. This indicates that even offers without a direct reward can influence customer behavior.
•	Question 4: How are customer demographics distributed?
o	Finding: The customer base is concentrated in the 30-70 age range, with a median income around $65,000. The gender distribution is fairly balanced, with a slight majority of female customers.

   

•	Question 5: Are there any demographic patterns in offer completion?
o	Finding: There is a clear and important pattern in offer completion based on age. Customers in the 30-50 and 50-70 age groups consistently have the highest offer completion rates. Gender does not appear to have a significant impact on offer completion.
o	Recommendation: Focus marketing efforts for rewards offers on customers within the 30-70 age range, as they are the most likely to convert.
